# Agricultural Fields Accounting System in the USA

## Introduction

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis and accounting of agricultural fields across the USA. Utilizing extensive datasets, our system demonstrates the importance of agricultural data and how it can be leveraged to make informed decisions.

The `code` contains `Main-code` which we use to create graphics in `graphics`.

## Objectives

The system aims to achieve the following objectives:

- **Yield Analysis**: Assess the yield of specific varieties depending on the year.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Calculate the revenue from different types of crops over various years.
- **Total Revenue Over Time**: Compute the cumulative revenue over the years and represent it through a linear graph.
- **State-wise Revenue**: Evaluate the revenue generated from agriculture by each state.
- **State Productivity Distribution**: Rank the states based on their agricultural productivity.
- **Common Crops**: Identify the most common agricultural crop in each state.
- **Waste Management**: Examine how agricultural products are disposed of in different states and determine the most popular method.
- **Water Basins Correlation**: Analyze the correlation between the revenue and the water basin each state belongs to.
- **Crop Distribution by State**: Distribute groups of agricultural crops by state.
- **Investment Opportunities**: Identify states that could benefit from increased investment in their agricultural sectors.

## Dataset Utility

The datasets used in this system are proven to be invaluable for constructing analytical models that can predict trends, evaluate state performance, and suggest areas for improvement. They allow stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to enhance productivity and efficiency in the agricultural sector.

## Conclusion

By analyzing various agricultural metrics and trends, our system provides critical insights that can help in planning and optimizing agricultural operations across the United States.
